# SWIPE-STACK

**SWIPE-STACK** is a modern re-implementation of the classic puzzle game *Tetris*, featuring a wireless glove controller and a dynamic LED-matrix-based main hub.

This project combines embedded systems design, wireless communication, real-time graphics processing, and custom hardware to create an innovative and portable gaming experience.

---

## Project Overview

The system consists of two main components:

### Glove Module
- **Input Device**: A wearable glove capturing hand movements and gestures.
- **Key Components**:
  - **IMU Sensor**: Collects motion and orientation data.
  - **STM32 Microcontroller**: Processes IMU data and converts it into game control inputs.
  - **HM19 Bluetooth Module**: Communicates inputs wirelessly to the hub via UART.
  - **LiPo Battery**: Powers the glove, with battery management provided by an off-the-shelf controller.

### Main Hub
- **Game Console**: Executes game logic, receives user input, and manages displays.
- **Key Components**:
  - **STM32 Microcontroller**: Runs the game engine and display drivers.
  - **HM19 Bluetooth Module**: Receives input data from the glove.
  - **64x32 LED Matrix Display**: Displays the active game screen, driven by a custom parallel interface using DMA and timers.
  - **OLED 16x2 Text Display**: Shows the current score and level via SPI.
  - **TI Buck Converter**: Provides regulated power for the system.


Each STM32 project (`Hub/` and `Glove/`) follows the typical CubeIDE structure, including source files (`Core/`), drivers (`Drivers/`), project configuration (`.ioc`), and build settings.
